    <h2>6.7.1 Information systems in medicine</h2>
    <BIG>computers are used in many areas of medicine, such as:</BIG>
    <ul>
        <li>keep patient records and pharmacy records</li>
        <li>us of 3D printers in many areas of surgery and customised medicines</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Patient and pharmacy records</h3>
    Doctors and hospitals need to keep accurate records of all their patients.<br>
    This is essential to ensure correct diagnosis and treatment. An up-to-date medical history<br>
    is part of the diagnosis process. Databases are kept by doctors and hospitals so that<br>
    data can be shared between medical practitioners and pharmacies (for example, to<br>
    ensure no drugs are prescribed which interact with each other in an unsafe manner).<br>

   <br>Databases also allow a quick and easy search for patient records – this could be<br>
   very important in an emergency, when accessing the patient’s medical history<br>
   could mean the difference between life and death. It also means that medication<br>
   can be prescribed without issuing paper prescriptions – an email could be sent<br>
   to the pharmacy instead.<br>

   <br>The sort of data which would be required on a patient database is as follows:<br>
   <ul>
       <li>a unique indentification number</li>
       <li>name and address</li>
       <li>date of birth</li>
       <li>gender (male or female)</li>
       <li>medical history(for example, recent medicine/treatment)</li>
       <li>blood group</li>
       <li>any known allergies</li>
       <li>doctor</li>
       <li>any current treatment</li>
       <li>any current diagnosis</li>
       <li>important additional information such as X-rays(T scans and so on)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Use of 3D printers</h3>
   3D printers were first introduced in Chapter 3. Their use in a number of fields is rapidly<br>
   progressing. One of the most innovative uses is in the field of medicine. The following<br>
   is just a small insight into the many developments taking place across the world.<br>
   <h1>Surgical and diagnostic aids</h1>
   It is possible to print out anatomical parts using 3D printers. These are used as<br>
   an aid towards diagnosis and surgical procedures. The patient is scanned using:
   <ul>
        <li><p style="color: rgb(193, 43, 92);">» CT(computed tomography)</p>-wich involves producing images of the internal<br>
        parts of the body series of thin slices less than 0.1mm thick, or </li>
        <li><p style="color: rgb(193, 43, 92);">» MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)</p>– this uses strong magnetic fields and<br>
        radio waves to produce a series of images of the internal organs in the body.</li>
   </ul>

  <br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  A 3D printer can then produce a three-dimensional representation of a patient’s<br>
  internal organs, blood vessels, major arteries, tumours and so on. The doctor<br>
  or surgeon can use this to show the patient exactly what is wrong and then<br>
  show them what procedures are required. This allows for patient engagement<br>
  which would be missing from the more traditional consultation methods. It can<br>
  also help the surgeons when planning surgical procedures because they can<br>
  see exactly what is required well in advance of the operation. In this way, 3D<br>
  printing systems can be used for diagnostic, pre-surgical aids.<br>
  
  <br>Some 3D printers produce hard nylon objects which are used in certain pre-<br>
  surgical planning. If a patient has suffered a bone break, for example, surgeons<br>
  can physically test and position screws and plates in the ‘3D bone nylon image’<br>
  prior to the surgery taking place. This reduces the chance of any errors when the<br>
  actual procedure is carried out.<br>
  
<h3>Prosthetics</h3>
3D printers are now being used to print out prosthetics (false arms, hands<br>
and legs). While state-of-the-art myoelectric prosthetics cost tens of<br>
thousands of dollars, the price for 3D-printing a prosthetic arm or hand can be as little as<br>
$100.<br>

<br>There is still much research needed in this field. However, the results to date<br>
are very encouraging, with many more people now having a chance to replace<br>
missing limbs at a fraction of the cost compared to existing methods.<br>
<h3>Tissue engineering</h3>
Recent advances have allowed the 3D printing of bio-compatible materials,<br>
cells and supporting structures. This has enabled the viability of producing<br>
artificial cells and tissues within a 3D printed object. 3D bio-printing (using<br>
bio-inks) is a very complex process and requires input from biologists, medical<br>
engineers, physicists and other engineers. It has already been used successfully<br>
to produce multi-layered skin tissue, bone tissue, heart/artery grafts and<br>
tracheal splints.<br>

<h3>Artificial blood vessels</h3>
One particular type of tissue engineering is the 3D printing of artificial blood<br>
vessels using human cells. These bio-printed tissues work in much the same way<br>
as natural blood vessels. Biomimetic blood vessels can be fabricated using 3D<br>
printing and bio-inks.<br>
<h2><p style="color: rgb(36, 53, 92);">Advice</p></h2>
‘Biomimetic’ refers to the imitation of elements that occur in nature (such as<br>
human cells) to create solutions to human anatomy problems.<br>
<br>‘Bio-inks’ are biological inks developed to work with 3D inkjet printers. By using<br>
3D layering, they produce artificial live tissue. These biological inks are made up of<br>
human cells and other materials (usually biopolymer gels).<br>

<br>Figure 6.25 shows a photograph of artificial blood vessels created from a 3D<br>
printer.

<h3>Customised medicines</h3>
3D printing techniques now allow scientists to customise medicines to suit the<br>
individual. This is known as patient-centric medicine. 3D printed medicines<br>
are sometimes referred to as printlets (printed tablets). As newly developed<br>
medicines are now very potent, and can have different effects on different people,<br>
there is now a need to review the manufacturing methods used to produce them.<br>
3D printing offers the possibility of creating personalised medicine which allows<br>
automatically controlled release of the medicine into the patient. It even allows<br>
multiple medicines, within a single printlet, to make fixed-dose combinations and<br>
allows for the optimum release of each medicine into the body.<br>

<br>3D printing achieves all this by adopting a new 3D inkjet technology, known as<br>
vapour printing. This is a new technique where layering of multiple medicines<br>
can be done by spraying them as a fine gas. The vapour printing process works by evaporating<br>
a powdered medicine and then combining it with nitrogen gas. The resultant gas is then<br>
sprayed onto a cooled surface where it crystallises to form a<br>
thin film. The building up of several of these thin films (using 3D printing) forms<br>
the desired tablet with a carefully controlled geometry. Traditional medicines, in<br>
tablet form, are formed by compression of the powder; each compressed tablet has<br>
the same shape. By exploring the connection between geometry of the tablet and<br>
the release of the medicine, it is possible to create the most effective medicine<br>
release profile for each patient. Some of the advantages of this technology include:<br>
<ul>
    <li>» tailor-made medicines to suit the individual</li>
    <li>» better control of medicine release into the body</li>
    <li>» saves money (many modern medicines are very expensive)
</li>
    <li>» better targeting of the medicine so its effects can be optimised</li>
      <li>» less chance of an overdose of the medicine, thus reducing harmful side-effects<br>
(for example, chemotherapy medicines can have very unwelcome side-effects;<br>
by reducing the release of the medicine to suit the individual, it will not only<br>
work better but also cause fewer harmful side-effects).</li>
</ul>

<br>In the future it should be possible to send medicines to local<br>
pharmacies in the form of a blueprint; each blueprint would be<br>
custom-made for the patient. By supplying the necessary materials,<br>
it would then be possible to 3D print customised medicines for each<br>
patient using the blueprint.<br>
